configuration-python
====================

# Description
These scripts allow the APIC configuration to be done in a local terminal
and thus provide a convenient and fast way for users to do APIC configuration.


# Contents

* generic\_code
  - scripts in this folder are generic. Each of them does a small function,
    creating a particular MO.  For the installation and usage of this code
    please see the README in the generic_code folder.
* lab
  - scripts in this folder are implementation scripts. They implement the
    functionality that utilize the code in the **generic_code** folder to make
    configuration changes on the APIC.
* template.py
  - This is not a valid script, rather it is a good template for a programmer
    to start from if they want to write a customized script. All the
    programmer needs to do is to redefine the functions in template.py.
